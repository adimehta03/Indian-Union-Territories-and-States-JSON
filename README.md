# Indian-Union-Territories-and-States-JSON

I was working on a project and couldn't find a file having the coordinates of all the Indian Union Territories and the States including Telangana in a JSON file format so I decided to make my own. 

<b>Download the <a href="https://github.com/adimehta03/Indian-Union-Territories-and-States-JSON/blob/master/states.json">states.json</a> and feel free to use it in a way it benefits you.

<em>SIDENOTE: To actually plot it on a map, you could use any of the external libraries which provides the user to input an external JSON file.</em>
